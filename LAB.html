        <p> One of the most important members of a research laboratory team are Laboratory Technicians. They are in charge of a variety of tasks and responsibilities such as the organization and maintenance of lab tools and equipment, data recording, as well as ensuring efficiency and accuracy when conducting scientific experiments and research.  
          Laboratory Technicians can take in a wide range of roles within the laboratory team depending on their area of expertise. They may work in several branches of scientific research and development, such as Chemistry, Physics, and Biology and may be employed by companies of various areas, including Forensics, Cosmetics, Manufacturing, and Pharmacology. Depending on the field, Technicians may work independently or under the direction of a professional.

            <h2>Laboratory Testing</h2>
            <p> Laboratory testing is performed 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The majority of tests are performed on
              site. Certain tests are referred to designated and approved reference laboratories.

              Testing is performed by registered medical technologists and other trained professionals using the latest
              in instrumentation. The rapid turnaround time the laboratory provides allows caregivers in locations as
              diverse as the emergency room, the intensive care units and the outpatient clinics to treat their patients
              in a timely fashion. Members of the technical staff attend in-service training and continuing education
              programs on a regular basis to maintain and improve their laboratory skills.

          pathologists, with specialties in hematopathology, renal pathology, cytopathology and neuropathology.

        <h2>Innovation</h2>

        <p>Mbala laboratories have long been an innovator for the laboratory industry in such areas as
          laboratory automation, quality control and information technology. Over the years numerous manufacturers
          have sought the expertise of the laboratory's professional staff to develop new instrumentation and
          methodology. Today our laboratory is in the forefront of development in molecular testing, which is
          revolutionizing how medicine is practiced.

          <p style="text-align:justify"> More than 4000 different laboratory tests are available today for clinical use, of which approximately 500
              are ordered on a daily basis. Today physicians, other health care workers and patients are finding it
              increasingly difficult to keep up with the tremendous amount of information being generated by clinical
              laboratories. This trend is expected to continue with the implementation of genomic testing and personalized
              medicine. Esoteric lab tests are projected to increase at an annual rate of 12%. Clinical pathologists are
              specialists who consult with physicians 24/7 to recommend the correct tests for their differential
              diagnosis, interpret the clinical significance of esoteric tests and answer physiciansâ€™ questions when a
              test result differs from their clinical impression.

              <hr style="background-color: rgb(151, 150, 187);"> Hospital and physician practice models are moving to
              fully integrated services. Inpatient, outpatient and outreach test results will need to be fully integrated
              within these new practice models. Hospitals and physicians will be taking on more risk. An integrated health
              system laboratory will play an increasingly important role in decreasing unnecessary testing and its
              associated downstream medical costs. Local clinical pathologists who work closely with the medical staff
              will have the most success at influencing physician ordering behavior.
